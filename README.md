## Day 01 – Database Commands

Today I learned how to:

- Create a database using CREATE DATABASE
- Select a database using USE (or set it as the default schema in GUI tools)
- Prevent errors while creating a database using IF NOT EXISTS
- Safely delete a database using IF EXISTS

I understood that SQL throws an error if we try to create a database that already exists.

conditional clauses like IF EXISTS and IF NOT EXISTS helps prevent errors and ensures safe, production-level SQL execution.
